# NLP 4 Mental Health Datasets üóÇ

The use of datasets in the Mental Health (**MH**) üè© field is often challenging as most of them are unavailable due to the private nature of the data. This can be a significant obstacle for *early-stage* researchers studying the linguistic characteristics of different behavioral disorders.

The purpose of this repository is to create a collection of resources that can help navigate the various sources that provide, both publicly and privately, datasets usable for research in Mental Health.

We divide the contents based on publicly available content (aka available in the **WWWW** - **Wild** World Wide Web) and datasets available upon request (by signing a data agreement or contacting the authors).

## Datasets available in the wild üèû

### DAIS-C corpus (2023)

The DAIS-C stands out as an exceptional open source resource due to its methodologically rigorous construction combining best practices in corpus linguistics with careful documentation of design decisions for clinical language data - probably one of the best resource you could ask for if you are a NLP practitioner in the field of MH. The corpus uniquely captures both schizophrenia and non-clinical participants discussing creative language use, with multiple file formats and annotation layers that support various types of analysis from computational to qualitative research.

### MENTALCHAT16K Dataset (2024)

MentalChat16K is a new English benchmark dataset for mental health counseling that combines two key components: (1) synthetic mental health counseling conversations generated using GPT-3.5 Turbo (10K conversations) and (2) anonymized transcripts from real interventions between Behavioral Health Coaches and Caregivers of patients in palliative/hospice care (6K conversations). The dataset is designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of large language models for mental health support, covering topics like depression, anxiety, grief and other mental health conditions.

### eRisk (2017-)

eRisk is a workshop focused on exploring evaluation methodologies, effectiveness metrics, and practical applications of early risk detection on the Internet, with particular emphasis on health and safety-related issues.
The workshop is organized annually as part of CLEF (Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum) and features various challenges for participants to solve. These tasks range from the early detection of mental health disorders to measuring their severity. The workshop has been providing datasets since 2017, with new tasks introduced each year.

### MBTIK9k (2018) & PANDORA (2021) Datasets

MBTIK9k is a dataset created by leveraging Reddit flairs - short descriptive tags that users employ to identify themselves in subreddits. In MBTI-related subreddits, users commonly include their MBTI personality type in their flairs, which the authors utilized to extract personality labels for the dataset.

PANDORA represents an advancement in this field, as it moves beyond the MBTI model, which has limited recognition in academic personality psychology, by incorporating Big Five personality labels. The dataset is further enhanced with demographic features, making it more comprehensive for research purposes.

Both datasets share the primary objective of inferring different aspects of personality based on users' Reddit posts.

### SMHD (2018) & RSSD (2017) Datasets

The SMHD dataset comprises Reddit posts from over 9,000 users with self-reported diagnoses across 9 mental health conditions (depression, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, autism, OCD, schizophrenia, and eating disorders) matched with 107,274 control users, created using high-precision patterns and careful control user matching. The RSDD dataset is similar in scale but focuses specifically on depression diagnoses from Reddit users, with an additional manual annotation step requiring three annotators to verify each self-reported diagnosis claim.

BDI-Sen is a dataset of 4,973 annotated sentences from Reddit covering all 21 depression symptoms specified in the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), along with 41,200 control sentences. The sentences were manually labeled by three expert annotators (including a psychologist) to indicate whether they provide information about specific depression symptoms. Additionally, each sentence has a severity level (0-3) derived from the original users' responses to the BDI-II questionnaire.
