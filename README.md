https://huggingface.co/datasets/ShenLab/MentalChat16K

### SMHD RSSD 

The SMHD dataset comprises Reddit posts from over 9,000 users with self-reported diagnoses across 9 mental health conditions (depression, ADHD, anxiety, bipolar, PTSD, autism, OCD, schizophrenia, and eating disorders) matched with 107,274 control users, created using high-precision patterns and careful control user matching. The RSDD dataset is similar in scale but focuses specifically on depression diagnoses from Reddit users, with an additional manual annotation step requiring three annotators to verify each self-reported diagnosis claim.

### PRIMATE

This paper introduces PRIMATE (PRocess knowledge Integrated Mental heAlth daTasEt), a dataset designed to help train conversational AI systems to generate appropriate follow-up questions when triaging depression cases. The researchers created PRIMATE by annotating Reddit posts against the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) depression screening tool, with expert annotators marking whether each PHQ-9 question was already answered in the post content.

### MetaHate: A Dataset for Unifying Efforts on Hate Speech Detection

MetaHate is a unified collection of 1.2 million social media comments compiled from 36 different hate speech datasets across platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and YouTube, with approximately 20% of the content labeled as hate speech. The dataset includes a diverse range of content types and annotation approaches, making it a comprehensive resource for studying and detecting online hate speech.

### DepreSym: A Depression Symptom Annotated Corpus and the Role of LLMs as Assessors of Psychological Markers

DepreSym is a comprehensive dataset of 21,580 sentences from Reddit labeled according to their relevance to 21 depression symptoms specified in the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), a standardized clinical questionnaire. The dataset was created by having three expert assessors (including a psychologist) annotate candidate sentences that were selected through a pooling approach from 37 different ranking methods submitted by research teams.

### BDI-Sen: A Sentence Dataset for Clinical Symptoms of Depression

BDI-Sen is a dataset of 4,973 annotated sentences from Reddit covering all 21 depression symptoms specified in the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), along with 41,200 control sentences. The sentences were manually labeled by three expert annotators (including a psychologist) to indicate whether they provide information about specific depression symptoms. Additionally, each sentence has a severity level (0-3) derived from the original users' responses to the BDI-II questionnaire.
